# WholeSaleSystem

An Inventory based Single Page Application project made using AngularJS for front-end, Spring framework for APIs, and Oracle (SQL - developer) for the backend.
The application had a User authentication-based system, session management, and a wide variety of products arranged based on sub-categories that can be added to the cart. It also had an alert system for the Admin user wherein the user was alerted if the inventory of a particular product reaches below the pre-configured stock level. The user then can allocate a bulk order to refill its inventory.
